                    <p>Recently I was able to work on the 3D platformer project on Unity, I was able to work on the assets on the scenes and incorporate scripts in C# for the movement of the player or even the camera.
                        Currently we are working on audio FX and the project is becoming more and more complete as time goes by.
                        Besides this I work on the algorithm in C or Python depending on the week </p>
